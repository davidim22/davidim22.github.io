### Identifying important sections in abstract using natural language process : SkimLit 

The purpose of this project is to use natural language processor to categorize each sentence in the abstract. I will be following the [*PubMed 200k RCT: a Dataset for Sequenctial Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06071) research paper. Additionally, I will be training on 20k dataset instead of 200k because of technical limits.
